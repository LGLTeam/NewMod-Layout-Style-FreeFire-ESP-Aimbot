# NewMod Layout Style with Free Fire ESP and Aimbot
A customized LGL Android mod menu, containing Canvas ESP, aimbot, hooking, and patching codes for Free Fire Android

This project is forked from KMOD https://github.com/KMODs-dev/New-Mod-Style-Layout-And-Mod-Menu but I fixed it to make it work for Android Studio.

Don't ask me how to use it, instead learn from the internet from Guided Hacking and Unknowncheats. Tutorials for PC can still be useful, they work the same, just the code that are slightly different

Mod menu is based on my old template

*This one is taken from a random Youtube video, didn't bother testing it. I can't confirm how it looks like... Let's just assume it look like this since this one has Canvas :))*
